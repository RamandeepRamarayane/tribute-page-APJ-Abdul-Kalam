            January 26, 1950 was a day of great pride for our nation. It was on
            this day that the Constitution of India came into effect, and the
            nation became a republic in the true sense of the word. All of us
            are aware of the immense struggle of our leaders to bring the nation
            to a position where it could be called a republic. But that was not
            all. The big question which prevailed thereafter was the one of
            development — economic, social and scientific.
          </p>

          <p>
            He was a renowned scientist in the field of Aerospace. During his
            career as a scientist, he proposed the then Defence Minister, R.
            Venkataraman for the simultaneous development of a quiver of
            missiles instead of taking planned missiles one after another. The
            cabinet allocated ₹388 crores for the mission, named the Integrated
            Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam as
            the chief executive. The programme was aimed at enabling India
            attain self-sufficiency in the field of Missile Technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dr. Kalam headed a Missile Study team to weigh the feasibility of
            the programme. The team included members from the Defence Research
            and Development Organisation (DRDO), the Army, Navy, Air Force and
            Defence Production. Keeping in mind the requirements of various
            types of missiles by the defence forces, the team recommended
            development of five missile systems. The ambitious, time-bound
            project brought together the country’s scientific community,academic
            institutions, industries and the three Services in giving shape to
            the indigenous strategic missile systems.

              Short-Range Surface-to-surface ballistic Missile-Prithvi
            </h3>
            <p class="tribute-item-description">
              The Prithvi missile is a family of tactical surface-to-surface
              short-range ballistic missiles(SRBM) and is India’s first
              indigenously developed ballistic missile. Development of the
              Prithvi began in 1983, and it was first test-fired on February 25,
              1988 from Sriharikota, SHAR Centre, Potti Sriramulu Nellore
              district, Andhra Pradesh. It has a range of up to 150 to 300 km.
              The land variant is called Prithvi while the naval operational
              variants of Prithvi I and Prithvi II class missiles are code named
              Dhanush (meaning Bow).
            </p>
            <p class="tribute-item-description">
              Prithvi II missiles were inducted in 1996. Prithvi III class has a
              longer-range of 350 km, and was successfully test fired in 2004.

              The Agni missile is a family of Medium to Intercontinental range
              ballistic missiles developed by DRDO of India and manufactured by
              Bharat Dynamics Ltd. The initial technology demonstrator version
              had a range of 1500 km but were based on a solid and a liquid
              stage,taking a long time for preparation before firing. Learning
              from this, the production variants of Agni now are solid-fuel
              based to allow for swift retaliation against adversaries.

              Trishul is the name of a short range surface-to-air missile
              developed by India as a part of the Integrated Guided Missile
              Development Program. It has a range of 9 km and is fitted with a
              5.5 kg warhead. Designed to be used against low-level (sea
              skimming) targets at short range, the system has been developed to
              defend naval vessels against missiles and also as a short-range
              surface-to-air missile on land. Guidance consists of three
              different guiding beams, with the guidance handed over
              progressively to a narrower beam as the missile approaches the
              target.

              Akash is a medium range surface-to-air missile developed as part
              of India’s Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme to
              achieve self-sufficiency in the area of surface-to-air missiles.
              It is the most expensive missile project ever undertaken by the
              Union government in the 20th century. Development costs
              skyrocketed to almost US$120 million which is far more than the
              other similar systems.

            <p class="tribute-item-description">
              Akash is a medium-range surface-to-air missile with an intercept
              range of 30 km. It has a launch weight of 720 kg, a diameter of 35
              cm and a length of 5.8 metres. Akash flies at supersonic speed,
              reaching around Mach 2.5 (3087 Km/hr). It can reach an altitude of

              3 to 7 km.
            </p>
            <p class="tribute-item-description">
              The missile uses an 8 kg tandem heat-explosive anti-tank (HEAT)
              warhead capable of defeating modern armour including ERA
              (Explosive Reactive Armour) and composite armour. Nag uses Imaging
              Infrared (IIR) guidance with day and night capability. Mode of
              launch for the IIR seeker is LOBL (Lock on Before Launch).
